          <p><i>Account data &nbsp;</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data collected by user account creation in the application.</p>

          <br/>  

          <h3><b>Explanation</b></h3>
          <p>This document presents what kind of user data our "clkBudget - Budget Management" application,
             which we offer to you as CLK Apps, needs and how your data is protected.
          </p><br/>  
         
          <h3><b>Purpose of Collection of Personal Data</b></h3>
          <p>clkBudget may ask you to signup to the app during use. The sign up process is completely left to the user's decision.
             In our application, you can create an account with an e-mail address and a password, or you can log in with your google
            account defined on your android phone. If you have created an account other than your Google account, you will receive
            a confirmation e-mail to your e-mail address. After verifying your e-mail address, your account can be used actively.
            If you are logged in with your Google account, verification will not be required.
          </p><br/>  
          <p>Signing in to our application will give you some advantages. It allows you to back up your income/expense data to your account,
             and to return to your most recent data backup when you accidentally delete an important record or records. It also allows you to
              synchronize your data on multiple phones at the same time (by logging in with the same account on all phones you have) and access
               the data backed up to your account on your new phone when you change your phone.
         </p><br/>  
         <p>Another advantage of the account creation process is that when you purchase premium content such as "Remove Ads", the content is matched
           to your e-mail address and you can use premium on all phones with the same account.
         </p><br/> 

         <h3><b>Data Requested by Account Creation</b></h3>
         <p>- With your Google Account; email, name, language<br/>  
            - With your e-mail address; e-mail, password (that you defined for clkBudget) data is requested.<br/>  
            - Moreover ; phone make-model, device language, operating system version
        </p><br/> 

        <h3><b>Data Collected Within App Functionality Without Account Creation</b></h3>
        <p>clkBudget is a budget management application and helps you to keep your income-expenditure records more easily, to monitor them statistically
           and to remember your due payments or receivables with the help of reminders. Within the scope of this functionality;
       <br/>  
          - The names of your income-expenditure records, their categories (market, fuel, etc.), relevant bank or credit card names are requested. <br/>  
          - Allows you to define credit card deadlines so that you can track your credit card payments more easily. <br/>  
          During the collection of this data, you will never be asked for security information such as User ID, Bank Account Number and Password, Credit Card and Password.
          Income-expense information, bank and credit card names, expenditure and income categories are requested to create statistical data that are purely for application functionality and are not used for any other purpose.
       </p><br/> 

       <h3><b>Storage and Use of Collected Data</b></h3>
       <p>Income-expense data and account data collected within the application are stored on the servers of CLK Apps and are never shared with third parties or companies.
         All collected data has no purpose other than to provide and increase application functionality.
      </p><br/> 

      <h3><b>Deletion of Collected Data and Your Account</b></h3>
      <p>You can request the deletion of all or some of the account and income-expense data you have created in the application and the account and income-expense data
         backed up in your account by sending it to our e-mail address below from your e-mail address defined in the application.
